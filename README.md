# telecom-churn-analysis

Orange S.A., formerly France Telecom S.A., is a French multinational
telecommunications corporation. In this EDA project, we were provided with the
Orange Telecom’s churn dataset, consisting of cleaned customer activity data
(features) and a churn level specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.
And here we need to explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible
for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer
retention.


In the first step, Import the raw data and perform data wrangling over it. It includes
data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation.
In the second step, we performed and checked some statistical properties of the data.
Which includes describing the data with mean, standard deviations, ranges and
getting the shape and size of the dataset, and checking categories/classes present in
each variable.


In the third step, we visualized the data through different features with statistical
properties that is affecting churn behavior to uncover the essential patterns and
trends between variables. And followed by data interpretation, which involves finding
patterns and analyzing the dependency of variables.


And lastly, we concluded the EDA by revealing the factors responsible for the churn
rate and the respective recommendations. Where the three most important factors
responsible for the customer’s decision on churn are Total day charge, Total day
minutes, and Customer service calls.
